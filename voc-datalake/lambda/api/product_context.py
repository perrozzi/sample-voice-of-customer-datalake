"""
Product/service description input — per-project context that feeds PRD/PR-FAQ generation.

Three pieces:
  1. ProductContext  — single mutable record per project (structured fields + free-form notes).
  2. ProductDoc      — internal documents uploaded by the user, turned into text by the
                       S3-triggered extractor at lambda/product_doc_extractor/.
                       WHAT IS PROCESSED: images (png/jpeg/gif/webp) and text
                       (.md/.txt). WHAT IS NOT: PDF and .docx are refused at upload
                       with an explicit "not yet" — no extractor handles them, and
                       accepting them only produced records stuck at status=pending
                       forever, with the UI badge reading "Extracting…" indefinitely.
                       See DEFERRED_CONTENT_TYPES.
  3. interview_turn  — one round of AI interview chat. The model uses a `update_product_context`
                       tool to patch the structured record; the assistant text is the user-facing
                       reply. Synchronous, returns {assistant_message, applied_patch} for simplicity.

`build_product_context_block(project_id) -> str` is consumed by projects.generate_prd /
generate_prfaq and substituted into the {product_context} placeholder.

# contradictory instructions rather than more grounding. Four describes one product's
# screens and keeps a coherent palette the likely reading.
#

#
# Per visual. An image's extracted text is a DESCRIPTION, not a file body: the
# extractor asks for a palette, a component inventory and a layout mode, capped at
# MAX_DESCRIPTION_TOKENS (4096) — so a maximal one is ~16k characters and a typical
# one is a small fraction of that. 3000 is deliberately the figure a reference spec
# document already gets in the prototype prompt (RESEARCH_PER_DOC_CAP, and the
# reference-document slice `_gather_context` applies): a visual is allowed to be as
# loud as one spec document and no louder. It binds only on a description that ran
# long, and what it cuts is the tail — the palette and layout lines the prompt acts
# on come first.

# limit note said four. The derivation stayed honest — it records what was used — but
# the UI's promise did not, and nothing anywhere said so. Deriving it means the budget
# can never refuse a selection the boundary accepted, and raising the bound cannot
# reintroduce the gap.
#
# It is still a real bound on the section, because the arity bound is small: 12,000

    A bare ``int(value or 0)`` is not safe on a JSON body: a string, an object, an

    TypeError / ValueError / OverflowError, which surfaces as a 500 for what is
    plainly a bad request. That mattered less when the number was advisory; it is
    now signed into the presigned PUT as ContentLength, so it is part of a
    security control and has to be validated like one.

    Which is also why the value has to be INTEGRAL, not merely convertible:
    ``int(1000.7)`` truncates to 1000, so a client sending a fractional size gets
    ContentLength 1000 signed into the URL and then PUTs 1001 bytes, which S3
    refuses with a signature/length error the caller cannot act on. A byte count
    that is not a whole number of bytes is a bad request, and it is answered here.

    Every unusable shape returns None rather than 0 so the caller's single size
    check answers with exactly the same ValidationError it gives any other
    unusable size — a caller does not need to learn a second vocabulary for "that
    is not a size", and a new message would be a new string to translate.

    off a JSON body, and json.loads produces int/float, never Decimal. It is

    """The quoted descriptions of the image documents a build SELECTED.

    Returns `(block, used_doc_ids)`: the assembled text (or `''` when nothing
    usable was found) and the ids whose text actually reached that text, in the
    order they appear in it.

    `used_doc_ids` IS THE PROVENANCE RECORD, so it lists what was USED, never what
    was requested — the convention `lambda/shared/derivation.py` documents for
    `sources`. Everything that drops an id (unknown, not an image, not ready,
    unreadable, empty, or refused by the total budget) therefore drops it from this
    list too, so a caller recording it cannot claim a visual the model never saw.

    THIS IS NOT `_injectable_docs`, AND THE TWO MUST NOT BE MERGED. That predicate
    excludes images on purpose (see its docstring); this one accepts nothing else.
    A selected TEXT document is ignored here precisely because it already reaches
    the prompt through `build_product_context_block` — including it in both would
    spend the budget twice for one document and say the same thing in two voices.

    ORDER FOLLOWS `doc_ids`, NOT `created_at`. The caller's order is meaningful:
    the consuming prompt tells the model that where two visuals disagree the first
    one wins, so re-sorting here would silently re-rank the user's choice. Wording
    that precedence is the consumer's job; this function only guarantees the order.

    Args:
        project_id: the project whose documents may be selected.
        doc_ids: the selected `doc_id`s, in precedence order. Any iterable; ids
            that are not non-empty strings, and ids that name nothing in this
            project, are ignored rather than raising — the value arrives from a
            request body, and one bad element must not fail a build.

    NEVER RAISES. An S3 read that fails, or extracted text that is empty or
    whitespace, skips that one visual and continues, logged as a warning exactly as
    the surrounding code does. Nothing on this path is worth failing a build for.
