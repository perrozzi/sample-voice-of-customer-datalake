"""
S3-triggered text extraction for project product documents (visual grounding, rung 2).

WHAT IT DOES
    Fires on every object created under `projects/` in the raw-data bucket, keeps
    only the keys that are product-doc uploads, and turns each one into plain text
    at `projects/{project_id}/product_docs/extracted/{doc_id}.txt`. The DynamoDB
    record written by `lambda/api/product_context.py::create_upload_url` walks
    `pending` -> `extracting` -> exactly one terminal state, `ready` or `failed`.

    Every write is conditional on the record still being NON-terminal, because
    the API's read path can fail a stalled record first and a late extraction must
    not undo that — see _update_doc.

    Text (.md/.txt): reading the bytes IS the extraction — they are copied through
    byte-for-byte.
    Images (png/jpeg/gif/webp): Bedrock describes the design in enough detail that
    the prototype builder can rebuild it WITHOUT the image (see
    IMAGE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT).

WHY NO aws_lambda_powertools, AND NO `lambda/shared/` IMPORTS
    `shared/model_config.py` imports `shared/logging.py`, which imports
    aws-lambda-powertools. Depending on `shared/` would therefore force this
    function onto a LayerVersion, and building that layer means container bundling
    inside VocCoreStack — a property that stack deliberately protects (its
    signing-key custom resource is written in Node precisely so CoreStack never
    needs Docker). Stdlib + boto3 only, like the two Python handlers CoreStack
    already ships (`lambda/custom_resources/admin_bootstrap.py`, `model_pin.py`).

    The cost of that isolation is this file re-implements four small things that
    exist in `shared/`: model resolution (see _resolve_model_id, which mirrors
    `shared/model_config.py::get_active_model_id` exactly), the reserved-word
    aliasing in the status writes (pattern from `shared/jobs.py`), structured
    JSON logging with per-record context (see JsonFormatter — powertools' output
    shape and `append_keys` behaviour, in a stdlib Formatter subclass, on a named
    logger that does not propagate, which is the shape powertools' own Logger
    takes), and the conditional-check-failure predicate (see
    _is_conditional_check_failure, which mirrors
    `shared/aws.py::is_conditional_check_failure`). All four are pinned by tests.

    WHAT THE ISOLATION DOES NOT COST is structured logs. Emitting plain text
    because powertools is unavailable would be a non-sequitur: the JSON shape is
    a formatter, not a library.

WHY NO NEW PIP DEPENDENCY
    Image dimensions are read from the file header with `struct` (see
    _sniff_format / _dimensions_from_head), so no Pillow. `imghdr` is NOT an
    option either — it was removed from the standard library in Python 3.13 and
    this function runs on python3.14.

    A NAMED logger that does not propagate — the same shape powertools' own
    Logger takes — which settles three things at once:

    NO DOUBLED LINE. The Lambda runtime pre-installs a plain-text handler on the
    ROOT logger, so a record that propagates there is emitted twice: once as JSON
    by ours, once as text by the runtime's. A doubled line reads like a retry
    rather than like a formatting mistake, so it misleads exactly the person
    reading the log during a diagnosis. `propagate = False` is the whole
    mechanism; detaching the runtime's handler (what this function used to do) is
    no longer needed, because our records never reach it — and detaching a handler
    the runtime owns would also have taken away the plain-text destination for
    every OTHER library that logs through root.

    NO SIDE EFFECT ON THE HOST. Configuring the ROOT logger at import time
    reformatted and re-levelled logging for whatever process imported this module;
    under pytest that is every other suite in the run, from one handler module's
    import. A named logger touches only itself.

    IDEMPOTENT. A second import or a reload must not add a second handler — that
    is how one log call becomes N lines, and nothing about the JSON output would
    look wrong while it happened.

    LINES STILL REACH CLOUDWATCH, which is the thing not propagating could
    plausibly have cost: the handler writes to `sys.stdout`, and Lambda forwards
    everything the function process writes there to the log stream. That is where
    powertools writes too. Binding the stream at import time is safe on either
    reading of the runtime — it wraps `sys.stdout` during bootstrap, before it
    imports the handler module, and unwrapped it is still fd 1, which the execution

Reply using EXACTLY these markdown sections, in this order, and nothing else.

## Palette
Give a CONCRETE 6-digit hex value for each of the eight CSS custom properties below. SAMPLE the colours from the image — read the actual pixels rather than guessing a plausible brand palette. If a role is genuinely absent from the image, derive it from the colours that are present and mark it "(derived)".
Write one line per property, in this exact form:
`--primary`: #RRGGBB - where it appears in the image
- `--primary`: the dominant brand/action colour (primary buttons, active states)
- `--primary-light`: a lighter variant of the same hue
- `--soft`: a soft muted fill of that hue (badges, selected rows, chips)
- `--tint`: the faintest tint of that hue (section backgrounds)
- `--bg`: the page background
- `--ink`: the primary text colour
- `--gray`: the secondary/muted text colour
- `--surface`: the card/panel surface colour

## Layout
State exactly ONE of these two words on the first line:
- `mobile` - a ~420px phone shell with a sticky bottom tab bar
- `desktop` - a full-width layout with a top navigation bar
Then give the visual evidence for that choice: device frame, status bar, bottom tab bar, side navigation, window chrome, content width relative to the image width.

## Screens
Every distinct screen or view visible in the image, one per line:
name - purpose - the main blocks it contains, top to bottom.

## Components
Every reusable UI component, one per line:
type (button, card, list row, tab bar, input, badge, chart, modal, avatar, ...) - where it appears - its visual treatment (fill, border, elevation, size, icon).

## Labels
Reproduce every piece of visible text VERBATIM, in the ORIGINAL LANGUAGE. Do not translate, correct, shorten or paraphrase, and keep capitalisation, punctuation, currency symbols and digits exactly as shown. Group under these headings: Navigation, Buttons, Headings, Field labels, Other.

## Shape and type
- Corner radius in px for buttons, cards, inputs and avatars — state each; give a range when they differ.
- Type treatment expressible with a system font stack ONLY (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial): relative sizes, weights, letter-spacing, all-caps usage, alignment. Do NOT name a webfont; the prototype is offline-first and cannot load one.
- Density and depth: spacing rhythm (tight/generous), border vs shadow treatment, and whether surfaces are flat or elevated.

If the image is not a user interface at all, say so on the first line of `## Layout` and still fill in `## Palette` from the colours actually present."""

    `attribute_exists(pk)` — the user can delete a document while its extraction
