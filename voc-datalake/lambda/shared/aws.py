# ── Bedrock generation budget ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE INVARIANT: these two numbers MULTIPLY, and the product must stay under the
# timeout of the Lambda making the call. At 300 x 3 it was 900 s — exactly the
# 15-minute job ceiling — so a generation needing over five minutes had no path to
# success and paid for three abandoned ones on the way. Pinned across both
# languages in lib/stacks/api-stack.test.ts and lambda/shared/test/test_aws.py,
# because no single file can see both halves.
#
# Why the retry budget is 1, since a longer timeout alone would not do it:
#   * `converse` is NON-STREAMING, so the socket is idle until the generation
#     finishes. A read timeout measures "big", not "broken", and retrying a request
#     that just consumed the whole timeout cannot succeed with less time left.
#   * botocore retries BELOW shared/converse.py's own loop, so its attempts are
#     invisible in the application log. `bedrock_call_with_retry` there is the one
#     policy that can tell a throttle (retry, nearly free) from a read timeout (do
#     not); botocore's single attempt budget covers both and cannot.
#   * One attempt keeps ONE cached client safe for callers of every length: the
#     budget equals the read timeout for everyone, so nobody is handed a multiple
#     of it. Shorter callers reach their own ceiling first, as they already did.
#
# `mode: 'standard'` is explicit because there max_attempts counts TOTAL attempts;
# legacy mode's reading of the same key is ambiguous. Same shape as
# shared/mcp_delegate.py. The 60 s left under the 900 s ceiling is for the handler
# to record the failure (shared/jobs.py writing the job `failed`) instead of being
# killed mid-flight.

    directions: N values under the per-value cap still add up past the service
