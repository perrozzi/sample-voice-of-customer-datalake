# to this many times, concatenating the chunks, so callers never persist a
# half-written PRD/PR-FAQ/report (the document-cutoff bug).
#
# Tuning note: keep per-call max_tokens MODEST (≈6-8K) rather than huge. A single
# huge maxTokens (e.g. 24K) makes one Bedrock call run many minutes for slow CJK
# output and can blow the Lambda timeout on its own; many small calls each finish
# in ~1-2 min and resume cleanly. This ceiling must therefore be generous enough
# to assemble a long document from those small chunks (8 × ~8K ≈ 64K tokens).
#
# STRICT-JSON DOCTRINE: auto-continuation is safe for prose but NOT for strict
# JSON output — the resume seam is lossy at token boundaries (live-caught: a
# dropped comma between continued chunks → JSONDecodeError). Callers that parse
# the response as JSON must size max_tokens so the answer fits in ONE call,

# thinking counts against maxTokens. See TestStrictJsonTokenHeadroom for the

# everything on thinking. At the previous 16384 that caller got zero retries (and
# before the upward-only clamp, a HALVED budget). 64000 lets 32000 double once,

# 420s, but their doubled retry is correspondingly cheap, so an inert guard there
# is harmless rather than wrong. Any caller that needs the guard to bind sooner

    THE POLICY LIVES HERE because botocore cannot express it: **retry a throttle,

    retrying it with backoff is nearly free. A read timeout means the generation
    itself outran the client's patience, and an identical request cannot go faster
    with less time left — see BEDROCK_READ_TIMEOUT_SECONDS in shared/aws.py, whose
    retry budget is 1 for exactly this reason. botocore's own retries could not
    tell those two apart, and retried both.

    Exposed (not underscore-private) for the RAW client callers: the product
    interview turn, persona import and manual-import classification each build
    their own Converse/InvokeModel request because they carry a tool config, an
    image block or an Anthropic-native body that the text-only `converse()` helper
    does not take. They previously leaned on botocore's attempts, which is not a
