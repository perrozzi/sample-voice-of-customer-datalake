 * cdk.json's CDK feature flags, resolved once for every case in this file.
 *
 * Read rather than listed because several flags change the SHAPE of the

 * file assert against a template no deploy of this project produces. The one the
 * S3-logging block below depends on is
 * `@aws-cdk/aws-s3:serverAccessLogsUseBucketPolicy`, which decides whether log
 * delivery is granted by a statement on the destination's bucket policy or by a
 * `LogDeliveryWrite` ACL — both of which render an identical
 * `LoggingConfiguration` on the source, so only a destination-side assertion can
 * tell them apart. Reading the file rather than pinning a literal keeps the test
 * and the deploy configuration from parting company unnoticed.
 *
 * FEATURE FLAGS ONLY — `committedFeatureFlags()` filters to `@aws-cdk`-prefixed
 * keys, and that filter is load-bearing for this file specifically. cdk.json's
 * `context` is also where project-level `-c` defaults would live, and several
 * cases here assert a CDK or app DEFAULT: `sets case-insensitive sign-in by
 * default (greenfield)` passes only while `omitUserPoolUsernameConfiguration` is
 * unset. A project key added to cdk.json and spread in here would invert what
 * those cases measure while they stayed green.
 *
 * These flags DO change this file's other blocks, which is intended and worth
 * naming rather than discovering: `@aws-cdk/aws-iam:minimizePolicies` merges IAM
 * statements, so the extractor role's default policy carries 6 statements here
 * against 10 under a bare `App`, the CDN signing-key policy 1 against 2, and the
 * KMS key policy 5 against 6. No assertion's outcome changes — the extractor's
 * S3 read and write statements have different resources and so never merge — but
 * a case that counts statements must be written against these numbers.
 * `merges IAM statements the way a real deploy's feature flags do` below is what
 * turns that from a comment into a guard.
