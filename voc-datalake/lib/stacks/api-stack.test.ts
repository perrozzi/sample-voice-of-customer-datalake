/**
 * Authorization invariant for every method on the VoC REST API.
 *
 * Regression guard for the Checkov CKV_AWS_59 finding on `/feedback-forms`.
 * The item routes sat behind an `anyMethod` proxy that was created without
 * `defaultMethodOptions`, so API Gateway defaulted them to
 * AuthorizationType.NONE: form update, form delete and reads of submitted
 * customer feedback were reachable with no credentials at all, while the
 * collection directly above them was Cognito-protected.
 *
 * The defect was a MISSING ARGUMENT. Nothing threw, no test broke, and a
 * cdk-nag suppression applied to the whole proxy subtree made the entire
 * prefix look assessed. A test asserting "these four routes are protected"
 * would not have caught it either, because the routes did not exist as
 * distinct constructs. So the guard is an invariant over the whole template.
 *
 * OPTIONS is excluded throughout because API Gateway generates unauthenticated
 * CORS preflight methods from `defaultCorsPreflightOptions`, and cdk-nag's own
 * APIG4 rule excludes them for the same reason.

 *  no per-call cost to bound, only gateway requests, and the stage-wide default
 *  (an explicit pair in its own right) already bounds those.
 *
 *  The trigger is therefore MOCK, and the assertion below is what fires on it: a

    // URL in a plain ```html fence failed. Both misses are the exact defect class
    // this test exists to prevent, and neither is exotic: a highlighter tag is
    // cosmetic, and what makes a URL copy-pasteable is the fence, not the label.

   *      figure, and was judged as though it had.
   *    - `| /submit | write | Sized for 50 MB/s of payload … |` — the bare
   *      `\/\s*s` alternative matches ANY `<word>/s`, so `MB/s`, `GB/s`, `ops/s`
   *      and `reads/s` all counted as stating a rate.
   *
   *  Both reproduced against the real documents before this changed. Requiring the
   *  digits makes selection match what `allStatedPairs` can actually parse, which
   *  is the property that was missing: a line is judged only if a rate figure is
   *  there to judge. `50 MB/s` no longer qualifies because the digits are not
   *  adjacent to the unit — `MB` sits between them.
   *
   *  Discovery gets the same treatment on purpose, and it does not lose reach for
   *  its job: a third document that PUBLISHES one of these ceilings states it in
   *  digits, which is the only form the lockstep can pin anyway (its own failure
   *  message says "digits, not words"). What discovery stops doing is flagging a
   *  document for mentioning throughput in prose. The two predicates keep their

   *  one line) and the anchored burst — not in what counts as a figure.
   *
   *  IT CAPTURES THE FIGURE, in group 1, so that `allStatedPairs` can be BUILT from
   *  this string instead of re-spelling it. Review found the re-spelling: the parser
   *  wrote its own `(\d+)\s*(?:${RATE_UNIT})` while its comment asserted the prefix
   *  was "exactly `RATE_FIGURE`" — an equality the compiler cannot check, and the
   *  same two-hand-kept-copies shape this block has already fixed for `PINNED_DOCS`
   *  and `PUBLIC_FORM_METHOD_KEYS`. They agreed at the time, which is what makes it
   *  worth fixing before they stop agreeing: the invariant the comment names (a line
   *  that is SELECTED is a line the parser can PARSE) is load-bearing, and breaking
   *  it in either direction produces one of the two failures described above.

    //
    // Requiring the two numbers to be ADJACENT does not close it either: in `was
    // 100 rps / 200 before` the correct pair IS adjacent, so that row still passes.
    // Checked against the falsified row before settling on the predicate below.

    // So it is not a search. Each candidate line is PARSED for the pair it STATES

    // somewhere on it". Both phrasings parse: "100 req/s, burst 200" and

     *  The two predicates keep their OPPOSITE BIASES, which is what earlier

     *  evaluated over the WHOLE FILE (over-inclusive, so a drifting third

     *  so a legitimate line is not failed). What they must not disagree about is
     *  the VOCABULARY, and they did: discovery accepted `requests/second` and
     *  `req/sec` while this accepted only `rps` and `req/s`, so a pinned document
     *  reworded to a broad-only spelling stayed DISCOVERED (satisfying the
     *  converse assertion) while every line of it stopped being a candidate here —
     *  and the `rows.length > 0` guard then reported "documents no rate limit for
     *  /config" about a document that plainly states one. The guard fired, so
     *  nothing drifted silently, but it named the wrong cause and pointed the
     *  author at the document instead of at the parse. Reproduced before fixing.
     *
     *  One alternation removes the class rather than the instance: any spelling
     *  either predicate recognises, both recognise. The biases live in the SCOPE
     *  and in the burst anchoring, not in the list of words for "per second".
     *
     *  A FIGURE, not just a unit — `RATE_FIGURE` requires digits adjacent to the
     *  unit. Selecting on the bare unit made this as wide as discovery and failed
     *  two legitimate lines; see `RATE_FIGURE`. */

     *  comes first and the stale-row defect survives with the clauses reversed:
     *  `raised from 100 rps / 200 to **250 rps / 500**` parses as 100/200, matches
     *  the template, and passes while the document publishes 250/500. Verified
     *  against the real steering doc before this was widened.
     *
     *  THE BURST IS ANCHORED TO THE TOKEN THAT INTRODUCES IT, not to "the next
     *  digits anywhere after the rate". An unanchored `[^0-9]*` spans any run of
     *  non-digits, so a row publishing NO burst still parsed one by adopting an
     *  unrelated later number — `| 100 req/s | burst raised in PR 200 |` yielded
     *  100/200, matched the template, satisfied the exactly-one check, and passed
     *  while telling an integrator nothing about the burst. A PR number, an issue
     *  reference, a version or a percentage later in the row was enough, and the
     *  row need not even be wrong on purpose, just reworded. Reproduced before
     *  fixing; that is the same class as the two defects the previous round fixed,
     *  one field over.
     *
     *  Both real phrasings put a word or a bare `/` immediately before the burst —
     *  `100 req/s, burst 200` and `**100 rps / 200**` — so requiring one of those
     *  two separators accepts every current row and yields ZERO pairs for a row
     *  that states no burst, which then fails as "states no parseable pair" rather
     *  than passing.
     *
     *  The rate-and-unit prefix here IS `RATE_FIGURE` — concatenated, not restated,
     *  which is the correction review asked for. `RATE_FIGURE` is what
     *  `statesALimit` selects with, so a line that is selected is a line this can
     *  parse — that equality is the invariant, and losing it in either direction
     *  is a defect this file has already seen twice. A NARROWER unit here would
     *  report "states no rate pair this test can parse" for a spelling the
     *  selector had just accepted; a WIDER selector would judge a line that never
     *  claimed a figure, which is what requiring the digits fixed.
     *
     *  It used to be a second spelling of that prefix with this comment claiming
     *  they were "exactly" equal. They were, so nothing was broken — but a comment
     *  is not a check, and the two copies could only stay equal by hand. Building
     *  the pattern from the constant makes the invariant hold by construction, so
