# Changelog

All notable changes to the Voice of Customer (VoC) Data Lake are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Versions are `0.x` on purpose: this is a sample platform whose interfaces still move between
releases, so a minor bump may carry changes that would be breaking in a `1.x` project. Read the
**Upgrade notes** of each release before deploying over an existing stack.

The version recorded here is the one in the `package.json` files. It is **not** what the dashboard
displays: the UI's build identifier is the short git commit SHA, injected at build time.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- An expanded prioritization row can enlarge the prototype it is showing to fill the viewport, in
  place, so a pitch session can look at the artifact without leaving the sliders, the team's numbers
  and the room vote behind on the page. Escape, the visible Close control and a click outside all
  return to the row. Offered for every prototype the row renders, including a legacy inline one and a
  JSON spec, neither of which has an address that "Open in new tab" could use.

### Fixed

- A CSV upload no longer overwrites an earlier one whose `id` column covered the same numbers.
  A row's identity was the `id` column value as written, and every CSV upload enters the pipeline
  under the single `source_platform` of `manual_import`, from which the processor derives both its
  idempotency key and its DynamoDB key. Row `1` of one file was therefore the same stored record as
  row `1` of every other file, so importing two 400-row exports each numbered `1..400` left 400
  records holding an arbitrary mixture of the two. Nothing reported the loss: both files were
  archived, and each upload answered with its own full row count, because that count is what the
  queue accepted rather than what was ultimately stored. Rows are now identified by a hash of the
  row itself — its `id`, text, rating, date, author, title, url and its own `source` column — so two
  files that reuse a number no longer conflict, while re-uploading an unchanged file still stores
  nothing new. A row with no `id` of its own also counts its position in the file, so a survey
  export whose free-text answers repeat verbatim keeps one record per answer — which does mean that
  reordering a file re-imports the rows in it that carry no `id`, while rows that carry one are
  unaffected.

  Two consequences are worth knowing before you re-import. Identity now follows a row's content, so
  re-uploading a file with a corrected row stores that row a second time instead of replacing the
  first; correct the data at the source and delete the earlier import rather than uploading over it.
  And rows imported before this release carry keys from the old scheme, so an environment that
  already holds a collided import should delete those records before importing the files again —
  importing on top of them leaves both generations in place. The `id` column each row carried is now
  kept on the record as `csv_row_id`, so a record can still be traced back to the row it came from.

- Feedback aggregation is now idempotent under DynamoDB Streams redelivery: the aggregate counter
  updates and a per-stream-event claim commit in one DynamoDB transaction, so replaying an event is
  a no-op instead of moving every counter a second time. `AggregateRecordReplayed` reports those
  skips and `AggregateTransactionConflicted` reports bounded in-process retries on hot rows.
- Shared modal dialogs now honour Escape and keep Tab inside themselves while focus is in a nested
  same-origin `<iframe>`. Keys pressed inside a frame are raised in the frame's own document and
  never reached the dialog, so any modal embedding one (the prototype overlay above) could not be
  dismissed from the keyboard once a reader clicked into its content. A frame the page cannot read
  into — cross-origin, or sandboxed without `allow-same-origin` — still cannot be observed, so
  dialogs embedding one must offer a visible dismiss control. One further exception is known and
  tracked as #386: a frame whose content rewrites itself with `document.open()` keeps the same
  document object while a compliant browser erases the listeners on it, so the dialog believes it is
  still listening there.
- Tab can now reach the controls inside a dialog's nested `<iframe>`. Descending into a frame is the
  browser's default action for a Tab pressed while the frame itself has focus, and the focus trap
  cancelled that action whenever the frame was the dialog's last focusable — which is the prototype
  overlay's shape — so focus bounced between the dialog's own controls and every link inside the
  artifact was unreachable by keyboard. A frame the page cannot read into, or one with nothing
  focusable in it, keeps the old behaviour: there would be nothing inside it to bring focus back out.
  This holds at any depth, so a prototype that embeds a frame of its own — a map, a video, a
  documentation pane — is reachable too, and leaving such a frame continues through the prototype's
  own content rather than jumping out of the artifact to the dialog's controls.
- Tabbing through a large prototype inside a dialog no longer slows down with the size of the
  prototype. Each keypress measured the whole embedded document to decide whether the key was leaving
  it — for a 400-control page, 2800 style resolutions per keystroke, nearly all of it to conclude that
  the key was an ordinary one the dialog should ignore. The question is now answered from the first
  control the key can still reach.
- A dialog whose embedded content replaces a frame of its own no longer accumulates one DOM observer
  per replacement. Each nested document is watched so that keyboard handling follows frames the
  content inserts itself, and a watcher for a document that had been swapped away was held until the
  dialog closed, keeping the discarded document alive with it. Watchers are now dropped as soon as
  their document leaves the frame tree.

### Security

- Plugin secret isolation now fails closed. Each plugin Lambda reads one shared Secrets Manager
  secret whose keys are namespaced `<plugin_id>_<key>`, and — because every ingestion Lambda shares
  one IAM role — that prefix is the only boundary between one plugin's credentials and another's. A
  prefix matching zero keys previously returned the **complete** shared secret, on the theory that
  such a plugin predated prefixing; the effect was that a typo in a plugin id, the input most likely
  to be wrong, produced the maximally permissive outcome. It now raises, naming the plugin and the
  prefix it expected and nothing else. The hand-maintained plugin-id list the filter needed is gone
  with it: forgetting to add a plugin there reclassified its keys as "shared" and leaked them into
  every other plugin.
- A webhook Lambda is now deployed with the environment variable its code reads for the plugin
  identity (`SOURCE_PLATFORM`, which only the ingestor Lambda carried). Combined with the above,
  a deployed webhook would otherwise have failed on every delivery.
- A Secrets Manager read that fails no longer counts against a plugin's circuit breaker. The
  fail-closed change above turned an unreadable secret into a refusal to start, and a refusal was
  counted as a plugin failure — but a read that failed is indistinguishable from an empty secret
  (the client error is logged and discarded), so a handful of throttles inside the breaker's window
  would disable a healthy plugin's ingestion schedule, which nothing re-enables automatically. An
  unreadable secret is now reported without being counted: the `plugin.failed` audit event still
  fires, and the run record moves to `error` on a *manual* run — a scheduled run has no run record
  to move, so an alarm on the `Refusing to load plugin secrets` log line is the escalation path for
  that case, and the exemption depends on it existing (see `docs/plugin-architecture.md`). Only a
  genuine misconfiguration — a malformed plugin id, a namespace holding no keys, or a secret whose
  body is not a JSON object — can trip the breaker.
- Every route taking a `{source}` path parameter now requires `source` to be a plugin that exists.
  Validating only its *form* left a cross-plugin credential write open, because the colliding value
  is itself well-formed: `source=app_reviews` with key `ios_app_id` stored `app_reviews_ios_app_id`,
  which `app_reviews_ios`'s next run then consumed as its own `app_id`. The synth-time guard on
  colliding plugin ids does not reach this — a colliding *stored key* needs no colliding manifest —
  so the namespace a request may address is now restricted to the manifest-derived ids CDK already
  hands this Lambda. It fails open if that variable is unavailable, so one bad environment variable
  cannot break credential management outright. `source` also reached an ingestor Lambda name and an
  EventBridge rule name unvalidated on the `/sources/{source}/*` routes.
- `GET /sources/status` validates the sources it takes from the query string. It is the only route
  whose source is not a path parameter, so the guard above did not reach it, and both of its
  branches derived a resource from an arbitrary value: `?sources=` named EventBridge rules it
  called `describe_rule` on — reflecting each rule name back, so an arbitrary value could enumerate
  rules and learn the naming convention — and `?run_status=` queried an arbitrary `SOURCE_RUN#`
  partition. The `?run_status=` branch now answers 400 for a source that is not a plugin. The
  `?sources=` branch reports such a source as `{'enabled': false, 'exists': false}` rather than
  raising, because it answers about several sources at once and one unknown name must not fail the
  whole response — and because its own default list contains `manual_import`, a legitimate source
  platform that deliberately has no plugin manifest. That is the same answer as before for every
  request the UI sends, since a schedule rule only ever exists per plugin. The `?sources=` list is
  also de-duplicated and capped now: validation bounds *which* rules may be described but not how
  *many* calls are made, and one valid name repeated 500 times issued 500 `describe_rule` calls while
  overwriting the same response entry each time — the caller chose the AWS call count against a fixed
  result, on an API throttled per account and shared with the rest of the stack. It is the only read
  in this handler that fans out one AWS call per list element.
- `POST`/`DELETE /integrations/{source}/apps`, `POST /sources/{source}/run` and
  `PUT /sources/{source}/enable|disable` now require the caller to be in the `admins` group. Only
  the two credentials routes were gated, so the boundary depended on which key a write happened to
  land under: a caller whose only group was `users` could write `{source}_configs` on the same shared
  Secrets Manager secret, invoke an ingestor (a billed third-party fetch, in a loop), and disable a
  plugin's ingestion schedule — which nothing re-enables automatically. `GET /integrations/{source}/apps`
  stays open deliberately: the Scrapers page lists app configs for every authenticated user, and a
  config holds a public app-store id and a display name rather than a credential. On that page the
  Run, Add, Save and Delete controls and the schedule toggle are now disabled for a non-admin, with
  the reason on hover, rather than issuing a request that 403s — and so is the Enabled toggle on the
  Settings page's source cards, which is the other UI caller of `enable|disable`.
- `Save to Secrets Manager` on the Settings page's source cards is now disabled for a non-admin.
  `PUT /integrations/{source}/credentials` behind it was already admin-gated, so unlike the toggle
  above this was not a regression — the control had always behaved this way, and it was the last
  ungated UI entrance to an admin-gated route. It was also the least visible failure of the set:
  that mutation has an `onSuccess` but no `onError`, so the 403 rendered no message and the button
  merely never became `Saved!` — a non-admin typed a credential, clicked Save, and got no indication
  it had been refused. The credential fields stay editable and `Test` stays available, because
  `POST /integrations/{source}/test` is not gated and a non-admin can already read those fields.
- `POST /scrapers`, `DELETE /scrapers/{scraper_id}` and `POST /scrapers/{scraper_id}/run` now require
  the `admins` group. No route in that handler had a gate, while two of them `put_secret_json` the
  SAME shared API-credentials secret the credentials routes protect — rewriting `webscraper_configs`,
  a key the webscraper ingestor consumes, so an unprivileged write steered which URLs got fetched —
  and the third invoked that ingestor, a billed third-party fetch callable in a loop. Gating only the
  `{source}` routes above would have left the boundary depending on which handler a write arrived
  through rather than on what it changed. The `GET` routes and `POST /scrapers/analyze-url` stay open
  to match the read/write split, and the Run and Delete controls on each scraper card are now disabled
  for a non-admin — as is **Save in the scraper editor**, which is the only UI entrance to
  `POST /scrapers` and was the worst of the three: the editor closed as though the change had been
  stored, because it closes unconditionally and its mutation surfaces no error, so a non-admin's edit
  was discarded silently. `scraper_id` is deliberately not allowlisted the way `{source}` is: it is
  not a plugin id and reaches no secret key or function name, only a `SCRAPER_RUN#` partition and the
  invoke payload, where the webscraper resolves it against its own configured list. `/scrapers/manual/*`
  is a **second** handler and is deliberately not covered: those routes write feedback content into
  the ingestion pipeline and reach neither the shared secret nor any plugin resource, which is the
  basis on which the three above were gated — see `docs/plugin-architecture.md`.
- A plugin's `plugin.failed` audit event is no longer lost when the circuit breaker's own DynamoDB
  lookup fails. The three reporting steps for a construction failure shared one `try`, and
  `record_failure` is not exception-safe on its first line (it resolves its table in a property,
  outside its own `try`), so a failure there skipped the audit event — in exactly the correlated
  case where the same DynamoDB trouble affects both, and on a scheduled run that event is the only
  signal the failure leaves anywhere. Each step is now guarded independently.
- `POST /projects/{project_id}/document` validates `doc_type` against an allowlist of `prd` and
  `prfaq` before creating the job. The field steered the job type, the execution path and the
  generated document's DynamoDB sort key straight from the request body, and each attempt billed a
  model call.

### Upgrade notes

- **A plugin must declare at least one key in its manifest's `secrets` block.** Following the
  fail-closed change above, a plugin whose namespace holds no key in the shared secret raises a
  `ConfigurationError` when its Lambda is constructed, rather than silently receiving every other
  plugin's keys. Every plugin shipped in this repo declares at least one key and CDK seeds them all
  at deploy time, so no bundled plugin is affected; a custom plugin declaring none must add a key,
  or override `_load_secrets` to return `{}` — a deliberate opt-out of the boundary. Declining to
  *read* `self.secrets` does not avoid the raise: both base classes call `self._load_secrets()` in
  `__init__`, before any subclass body runs. A test over the manifests now fails in CI
  rather than letting this surface in a deployed Lambda. Any onboarding notes telling a plugin
  author to register their prefix in `_get_known_prefixes()` are obsolete — that function no longer
  exists, and registration was never needed for a correctly prefixed key.
- **A plugin id may no longer be a prefix of another plugin id** (`app_reviews` alongside
  `app_reviews_ios`). Secret keys are matched by string prefix, so the shorter id would receive the
  longer one's credentials. `cdk synth` now refuses such a pair, which is the only point at which
  the whole id set is known. No bundled pair collides.
- **`source` on every `{source}` route must now be a configured plugin id.** A request naming a
  well-formed but non-existent source (`app_reviews`, `webscraper_admin`) is answered 400 instead of
  reading or writing that namespace, invoking `voc-ingestor-<source>` or toggling
  `voc-ingest-<source>-schedule`. Anything addressing a real plugin id is unaffected, which is every
  call the web app makes; a script that relied on an arbitrary namespace must use the owning plugin's
  id. Neither this nor the synth-time id guard is retroactive: a key stored by a pre-upgrade write
  survives in the shared secret and is still read by whichever plugin's namespace it landed in.
  A deployment where an arbitrary `source` was used should delete the stale keys by hand.
- **`GET /sources/status?sources=` accepts at most 50 distinct sources per request** and answers 400
  above that. Counted after de-duplication, so repeating one name is not what trips it, and set well
  above both the five plugin manifests and the route's own three-source default — the web app asks
  for at most one source at a time, so no UI call approaches it. A caller passing the same source
  more than once still receives the identical response; only the redundant `describe_rule` calls are
  gone.
- **Triggering a run, toggling a schedule, and writing or deleting an app config now require the
  `admins` group.** A caller in `users` alone receives 403 on `POST /sources/{source}/run`,
  `PUT /sources/{source}/enable|disable` and `POST`/`DELETE /integrations/{source}/apps`. Listing app
  configs (`GET /integrations/{source}/apps`) is unchanged and still open to any authenticated
  caller. A non-admin who previously used the Scrapers page to run a source or edit an app config now
  sees those controls disabled; a script doing the same needs admin credentials. The same applies to
  the scraper routes: `POST /scrapers`, `DELETE /scrapers/{scraper_id}` and
  `POST /scrapers/{scraper_id}/run` answer 403 outside the `admins` group, while `GET /scrapers`, the
  status and run-history reads and `POST /scrapers/analyze-url` stay open. On the Settings page the
  Enabled toggle is now disabled for a non-admin, where it previously issued a request that failed
  silently — as is `Save to Secrets Manager` on the same card, whose route was already admin-gated
  but whose refusal rendered no message at all — and in the scraper editor so is Save, where the
  modal previously closed as though the edit had been saved. The manual-import routes
  (`/scrapers/manual/*`, a different Lambda) are unaffected and stay open to any authenticated caller.
- **`POST /projects/{project_id}/document` now answers 400 for any `doc_type` other than `prd` or
  `prfaq`.** Matched exactly, with no case folding or trimming, so `PRD` and `" prd"` are refused
  too. Previously accepted values that now fail: `build_prototype`, `product_report` and the empty
  string. The web app is unaffected — it only ever sends the two accepted values — but a script or
  integration calling this route directly may need updating. `build_prototype` and `product_report`
  have their own routes (`POST .../build-prototype`, `POST .../product-report`); use those instead.
- **The same route now answers 400 when the request body is present but is not a JSON object** —
  an array, string, number or boolean, including the falsy ones (`[]`, `false`, `0`, `""`). These
  previously started a default `prd` generation. Unparseable JSON is a 400 too, where it was
  previously a 500. A body that is absent altogether, a literal JSON `null`, or zero-length
  (`Content-Length: 0`), still means "generate a PRD with the defaults" and is unchanged.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-19

The first release since the platform moved from a single-stack sample to a workspace covering
research, prototyping and team prioritization. Roughly 120 changes, developed between 2026-06 and
2026-08.

### Added

**Project research workspace**
- Research projects that generate personas, PRDs and PR/FAQs from the feedback corpus, run as
  asynchronous jobs with a Background Jobs panel for long-running progress.
- Document provenance: each generated document records and shows how it was built, and which
  specification a prototype was built from.
- Prototype builds that read product context and research, and can be grounded in the mockups they
  were aimed at.
- An MCP endpoint so external agents can read project data, with a two-card Export / MCP layout.

**Team prioritization**
- A prioritization row now represents a project rather than a single document, with ballots keyed to
  the row and PRDs scorable alongside PR/FAQs.
- One ballot per reviewer, replacing a single shared score map, with rows leading on the team score.
- Room voting: a meeting scores a proposal from their phones through a session QR code.
- Linked feedback forms surface their collected ratings on the matching prioritization row.

**Conversational and AI surfaces**
- Streaming chat over Server-Sent Events, served by a TypeScript Lambda through API Gateway.
- A per-surface AI model picker over a curated Claude allowlist, so chat, documents, prototypes,
  enrichment and utilities can each use a different model.
- Opt-in public web search through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, with agentic multi-query research
  grounding for chat and research. Deployed by default, and switchable off.
- A `create_project` tool callable from chat, plus aggregate search mode and urgency sorting.

**Internationalization**
- A runtime i18n layer with eight locales and a language switcher, replacing hardcoded English.
- Parity guards in CI-style tests so a missing key in one locale fails a check rather than silently
  rendering a raw key path.

**Data sources and ingestion**
- CSV bulk upload with a 50,000-row cap, batched to SQS, with an upload modal.
- A synthetic data review generator plugin, and a persistent Data Sources card for generators.
- Mobile app review ingestion and a rebuilt scrapers UI.
- Ingestion provenance (`ingestion_method`) persisted on each feedback record.
- Feedback forms can be shown as a scannable QR code for a public submission page.

**Interface**
- A flow-ordered sidebar and a Home onboarding page.
- A route-level error boundary, so one failing page no longer blanks the application.
- A shared modal component that owns dialog semantics and keyboard handling.
- Filtering by review date versus imported date across the application, honoured by chat, research
  and MCP.
- Marking problems as resolved in Problem Analysis.
- Category distribution moved to Signals, the Feedback tab consolidated into Categories, and Data
  Explorer tabs slimmed.

**Operations**
- An opt-in deployment prefix, allowing two independent copies in one AWS account.
- Workshop artifacts made deployable, within a five-CloudFormation-template limit.

### Changed

- Claude Opus 4.8 upgraded to Opus 5; AI budgets are configuration-driven rather than hardcoded.
- Persona generation fans out avatar creation and drops a validation step that discarded work.
- Metric windows are read in a single query instead of one lookup per day.
- The two `us-east-1` AI-enablement stacks were merged into one, keeping the stack count at five.
- DynamoDB GSI names now come from a single source of truth.

### Fixed

- Persona generation no longer silently discards most of the feedback corpus.
- Ingestion pages through complete review sets instead of stopping at the first page, and no longer
  loses feedback when an SQS batch send partially fails.
- Feedback form submission counts are honest, with one partition per form.
- Problem Analysis counts over the whole window rather than its first page, and the urgent count
  reports the true total.
- Prioritization reports partial ballots honestly instead of presenting an incomplete average as
  complete.
- Chat conversation and message identifiers are collision-proof, and streamed replies land in the
  conversation they came from.
- Data Explorer queries an index that exists.
- Recurring crash fixes for sparse or legacy records: scrapers without a base URL, categories without
  identifiers, forms without a theme.
- PDF import is refused rather than producing an invented persona.
- Deployment reliability: eternal ingestor asset hash churn, a mismatched bundled botocore, and
  pre-existing stacks blocked by a create-only Cognito property.
- Repo-wide lint and test debt zeroed, with every surface gated.

### Security

- Chat conversations are partitioned by authenticated user, replacing a shared partition that placed
  every user's history together.
- Cognito authentication is required on feedback-form item routes that were reachable unauthenticated.
- The deprecated Cognito implicit OAuth grant is disabled.
- Avatar and prototype objects require signed URLs.
- Raw Lambda events are no longer logged, with a CI guard against reintroduction.
- MCP access uses constant-time token comparison, enforced scope, a narrowed IAM policy, a working
  throttle, an Origin guard and token expiry.
- Free-text fields on the streaming path are bounded and replayed history is clamped.

### Upgrade notes

- **Chat history written before this release becomes unreachable.** Conversations are now keyed by
  authenticated user subject; there is no migration, and the change is deliberate.
- Deploying over a stack created before the Cognito username change may require
  `-c omitUserPoolUsernameConfiguration=true`. See `docs/deployment.md`.
- Web search deploys by default. Opt out with `-c enableWebSearch=false`.
- Lambda layers must be built for ARM64 before deploying: `./scripts/build-layers.sh`.

### Toolchain

- Frontend tests run on Vitest 4. Vite is deliberately held at 7.x: Vite 8 replaces the bundler with
  Rolldown, which requires `manualChunks` to be a function and rejects the object form this project
  uses. That migration is tracked separately.
- After pulling this release, run `npm ci` in `voc-datalake/frontend` — an existing `node_modules`
  from before it will be stale.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-25

Initial release of the sample: a fully serverless platform for ingesting, processing and analyzing
customer feedback on AWS.

### Added

- Plugin-based ingestion, where each data source is self-contained and declares its infrastructure,
  UI configuration and credentials in a `manifest.json` consumed by CDK.
- An event-driven processing pipeline: raw payloads archived to S3, queued through SQS, enriched by a
  processor Lambda using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Comprehend, and aggregated in near real time off
  DynamoDB Streams.
- Multi-language support with automatic language detection and translation.
- A REST API split across domain-specific Lambdas, behind API Gateway with Cognito authentication.
- A React dashboard with metrics, charts, AI chat and project management, served through CloudFront.
- A web scraper plugin, embeddable feedback forms, and an S3 import plugin.
- Encryption at rest with a customer-managed KMS key, and cdk-nag suppressions recorded where AWS
  services do not support resource-level permissions.
